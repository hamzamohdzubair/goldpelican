# Introduction

## What is this book about?

Rust in the last few years has turned out to be a powerful programmign language that can be used in several settings for many different tasks. In this book we will learn how to build a simple application for each of the following settings:

- CLI: Command Line Interface
- TUI: Terminal User Interface
- GUI: Graphical User Interface
- API: Application Programming Interface (REST)
- WUI: Web User Interface
- AUI: App User Interface
- PI: Physical Interface (Embedded)
- GI: Game Interface (Game Engines)
- AI: Artifical Intelligence

First we'll look at what is the current state of technology for each domain. What libraries are present. For each domain we'll try to do an exhaustive comparison of different crates and libraries present. Then we will proceed to select one or two and build a simple application.

## Motivation

> I don't believe that you should use the most suitable language for a specific domain or problem at all costs. I think consistency among your / company projects, productivity and simplicity should have the highest priority. And Rust is a very universal language so I think it's a good choice for almost all cases.

## Future Goal

One of the goals of this book is also to be able to build an app with fixed buisness logic and a changeable interface.
